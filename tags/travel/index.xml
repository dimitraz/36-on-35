      <description>A few shots taken in Glasgow on my Canon AE-1 with a 50mm 1.8. The Canon AE-1 was my first ever film camera, which I got almost a decade ago, so we go back a long time.
I think the film stock was some pound store Agfa Vista 200.

      <description>I went to Morocco and somehow thought it would be a good idea to shoot that entire trip on some really bad quality disposables I bought while I was there. I had a few left when I came back, so here are some from various trips I used them for after that.
